## Not Running Away

Wherever I go, my memories and thought patterns go with me. Whatever activity I choose to do can be so chosen (possibly subconsciously) as to muffle the sound of those thoughts I don't want to hear; but that can be only temporary.

This is related to living this one life and not cramming in multiple lives at the same time (next chapter).

Necessary things to realize:



*   The problems I subconsciously escape from.
*   I can allow myself to not like certain things, places, situations. (And that this is orthogonal to avoiding them.)
*   I can allow myself to have the freedom to shape my life.
*   I can allow myself to not force myself to endure things I don't really have to.
*   I am free to enter psychotherapy (and free to choose the therapist).
*   There is no running away from uncertainty.
*   My mind shapes my view of the world.
*   My thought patterns, mental problems and healthy parts of my mind determine how I interact with the world and filter the people I (can) interact with.

Last but not least, a special way of running away - running away while staying at the same place - is the act of ignoring a crucial part of reality (e.g. a responsibility) and is toxic to the people around me.
