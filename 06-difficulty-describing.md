## Difficulty in Describing the Meaning of Life



*   Making intellectual sense of brain, matter, universe, and therefore of the true meaning of life on all levels of meaning of "meaning", is impossible.
*   General all-encompassing meaning of reality is isomorphic to *that* reality, and therefore cannot be fully described inside *that* reality.
*   General all-encompassing meaning of life is exactly *that* life; anything less is an imprecise simplification.
*   Moreover, the general all-encompassing meaning of life depends on the reality in which it exists.
*   Inability to describe the meaning of life is the inability to agree with a simplified description, or a disagreement about what level of simplification is the correct one.
*   Consensus and resolution can be reached for each mind only inside that mind, and hence can be truly reached only for one's own meaning of life, and only falsely as a delusion reached for one's understanding of the meaning of the lives of others and of the general meaning of life.
*   Conscious intelligence cannot fully comprehend and describe the reality of life and therefore all its meanings, for feelings, as an example, are wholly different when felt by the I-feeler than when intellectually thought about.
