## Difficulty in Describing the Meaning of Life



*   Making intellectual sense of brain, matter, universe, and therefore of the true meaning of life on all levels of meaning of "meaning", is impossible.
*   General all-encompassing meaning of reality is isomorphic to the reality, and therefore cannot be fully described inside that reality.
*   General all-encompassing meaning of life is exactly the life; anything less is a simplification and imprecise.
*   Moreover, the general all-encompassing meaning of life depends on the reality in which it exists.
*   Inability to describe the meaning of life is the inability to agree with a simplified description, or a disagreement about what level of simplification is the correct one.
*   Consensus and resolution can be reached for each mind only in that mind, and hence can be truly reached only for one's meaning of own life, and falsely as a delusion reached for one's understanding of meaning of others' lives and of the general meaning of life.
*   Conscious intelligence cannot fully comprehend and describe the reality of life and therefore all its meanings. For e.g. feelings are wholly different when felt by the I-feeler than when intellectually thought about.
