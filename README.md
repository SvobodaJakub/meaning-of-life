## Introduction

My theory does not have to be objectively flawless because I mostly use it from my subjective point of view. However, it should be good enough to withstand confrontation with reality for the rest of my life. 

I borrow most of my ideas from other people, since there are far greater minds with far greater wisdom and knowledge than mine. The listed quotes are an integral part of the theory.

Just as the availability of information on the Internet helped me in the pursuit, I freely publish the ideas back on the internet to inspire others. If one other person's mind is enriched, it will have been worthwhile.
