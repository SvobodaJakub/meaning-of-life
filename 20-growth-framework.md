# Growth Framework

Inspired by Tim Urban's article [http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html](http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/10/religion-for-the-nonreligious.html), I created my growth framework. I use it to track wishes, needs, and progress on my path on and towards my meaning of life. It is highly personal and personality-specific. These categories work for me:



*   meaning of life
*   spiritual growth
*   mental growth
*   long-term planning
*   parenting
*   finances and living
*   personal IT skills growth
*   work skills growth
*   practical life in general
*   personal connection

For each category, there are these sections:



*   Overview of my goals and of the spirit of the topic
*   Relevant books
*   Relevant Firefox bookmark folders
*   Relevant [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/) tags
*   Relevant [Woolnote](https://github.com/SvobodaJakub/WoolnoteAndroid) tags
*   Long-term goals
*   Yearly goals
*   Short-term tasks

My motivation was inspired by this paragraph of the article:

"*When I dove into this topic, I thought about my own situation and whether I was improving. The efforts were there—apparent in many of this blog's post topics—but I had no growth model, no real plan, no clear mission. Just kind of haphazard attempts at self-improvement in one area or another, whenever I happened to feel like it. So I've attempted to consolidate my scattered efforts, philosophies, and strategies into a single framework—something solid I can hold onto in the future—and I'm gonna use this post to do a deep dive into it.*"
