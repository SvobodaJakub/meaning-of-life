## Reality After Death is an Illusion



*   I see people die and I'm still here, still thinking, so I think about what it is like being dead.
*   My reality is in my mind. It ceases to exist when my mind stops existing. However, the realities of the living keep on existing.
*   Hence the illusion.
*   It is difficult to imagine nothingness, to imagine not being. Imagining an eternity of consciousness in a void is the wrong idea but it is the readily available idea (there is no consciousness in not being).
*   "In unconsciousness all times are the same brief instant." (Alan Watts)
