## Existence After Death



*   The closest to having a continuing mental existence after death is in others' thoughts.
    *   It shares some qualities - is in the minds of other beings of the same species, is a mental process, affects decision making.
    *   The original I-feeling and the original I-feeler are lost and new ones are there instead.
*   It can provide meaning during life.
    *   Let it be good thoughts.
    *   I can't judge or see it after my death. But I judge myself during my life in relation to the predicted effects of my life, and that is a part of my metrics of what is good and bad during my life.
