# Free Will

There is a great deal of literature about free will and so I tackle it from a different perspective. Our free will is predetermined by the whole physical process of the universe we are a part of, and hence is not entirely free in all conceivable ways, since we are merely limited humans. Each human is a part of the process and their actions are part of the process and change the process. Each human then has a domain in which their will is free and makes a difference. Outside of the domain, the free will doesn't exist.
