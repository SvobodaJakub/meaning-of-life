# Reality, Things, Events



*   Reality is one whole interconnected process, there are no parts that are fully separate and independent of it.
*   We recognize some parts of reality as being independent or separate, and we call them things or events.
*   Some things or events are so interconnected and dependent we still see the connection intuitively. For others though, we don't intuitively see the connection and think of them as wholly separate or independent.
