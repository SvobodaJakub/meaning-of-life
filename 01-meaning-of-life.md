## Personal Take on the Meaning of Life

I can't definitely know whether there is god and what god is on all levels of meaning. I know there is wind, and trees, and stars, and whole lot of matter in the universe. I'm just a small lump of matter. I'm just a small lump of matter that is somehow special in its arrangement from the majority of matter in that I am aware of something. I have my own priorities and will and I find my own meaning in the existence because it's not that much of the other matter cares about me. I have some information already encoded in me, and also in other people, probably by the way I (and we) came into existence. We came from other matter and in us is encoded how we can be one with it. That is the thing we have been with the longest time. I should listen to this voice, rather than to the other voices that came into existence from detachment, ignorance, vanity, endless pursuit of unachievable goals. There is no evil in the nature, and there is no vanity, no good, no bad. Nature just is, as the matter just is. Maybe these human concepts also became encoded in us, and maybe it's a feedback loop together with our increasing state of being lost. If there is something that can help us escape this state and find ourselves again, it's in the much older nature rather than in our modern civilization and pursuit for the sake of pursuit.

The answer about the meaning of the life is probably nothing concrete yet probably nothing complicated either. It's probably something that has existed with us and in us longer than our civilizations, ideas, or the concept of god.

There are two levels to the answer. The first deals with everything, and the second with humans. At the first level, there's no other meaning in nature than the exact way of its existence which is its only meaning. There's no need for much else since the concept of "meaning" is anthropomorphic. At the second level, there are humans whose brains work in such a way that we need a meaning, or answer, or explanation. A lot of our actions are just a coping strategy of being on terms with the fact that ultimately we have no definite answers.

Since the humanity came to no satisfactory conclusion so far, by an improvised induction I infer that it won't come to one in my lifetime. And since I need an answer, a coping strategy, and none of the existing answers so far fully satisfy me, I need to find one myself, just for me. Some people came very close to with what I identify with, and their work helped me immensely in my journey towards the answer.

There is no single concrete goal to pursue. I need to be happy and to do things that I feel are good and right. As indescribable a soul is, as indefinable is the definition of the good action. From there, everything else unwinds.
