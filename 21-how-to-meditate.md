## How to Meditate

This is my own take on meditation, I'm not saying this is the best way.



*   Integrate meditation into the whole day, into walking, sitting, waiting, working, even into times around problem solving, into times of stress, into times of happiness.
*   Main ingredient of meditation is mindfulness - perceiving whatever there is, whatever emotions I have, without categorizing, without judging, without trying to change it.
*   Another ingredient of meditation is the kindness to emotions, memories, myself, people

*   A stressful moment is a reminder to meditate
    *   "*While you are driving your car, you might notice the tension in your body. You are eager to arrive and you don't enjoy the time you spend driving. When you come to a red light, you are eager for the red light to become a green light so that you can continue. But the red light can be a signal. It can be a reminder that there is tension in you, the stress of wanting to arrive as quickly as possible. If you recognize that, you can make use of the red light. You can sit back and relaxâ€”take the ten seconds the light is red to practice mindful breathing and release the tension in the body.*" - Thich Nhat Hanh, https://www.mindful.org/five-steps-to-mindfulness/
*   I can meditate about a certain thing, trying to comprehend or realize the thing deeply, which can give me an insight and give me ideas to make something better.  Or I can meditate just to be in the here and now, to be with my emotions and thoughts, to be here to cherish the moment, e.g. to enjoy the moment with a loved one, to really live it and live it through, to fully perceive and fully listen, to be thankful, to be happy for the many things I find good, to realize the nature of things I deem bad, to realize my judgements, to try to free myself from seeing in old ways, to try to see through child's eyes, as if it is for the first time, with a child-like wonder, to let up things that preoccupy me and just be present in the moment.
