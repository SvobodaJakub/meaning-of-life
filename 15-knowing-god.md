## Knowing my God

I do not fully know the nature of God. I don't know whether it will ever be possible. I can learn certain minutiae and have a little better idea. Maybe I can learn something new and crucial that changes my beliefs. I am open to change and to learning. This is the way I came to this point and I think this is the way I can learn more about everything, and appreciate everything fully. There is no place for dogma. To be willing to change my beliefs as I learn more is to be receptive to moments of sincere gratefulness and wonder.
