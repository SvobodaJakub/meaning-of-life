# Meaning of Life in General



*   "Meaning" is a human concept used to show a relation between facets of reality we call "events" or "things".
*   The term "meaning of life" has little sense unless the meaning of the term is further specified.
    *   E.g. what meaning of the word "meaning" is to be used, what level of understanding it describes.
*   "Meaning" is the seeking of the answer for "why?".
*   The meaning of something can be found on many levels.
*   The question makes sense only when it is clear on which level it is considered.
*   Example: I see beautiful leaves in the sunset.
    *   I see the leaves because I have eyes.
    *   I process the information because I think and because of the way I think.
    *   I find it beautiful because of evolution and a multitude of other events and properties of my body and mind.
    *   The leaves are there so that the tree can breathe.
    *   The tree is there because life evolved so.
    *   Life is there because molecules combined into self-propagating structures.
    *   The molecules exist because of the ways elementary particles and interactions work.
*   Some levels need a lot of work so that an explanation can be found, some can't be explained by the human mind, some can't be discovered or comprehended by the human mind.
*   The reality in general doesn't have the concept of meaning; humans as a part of reality do. We might mistakenly try to look for meaning where there may be none.
*   Language allows such a construction as "meaning of life", so we mistakenly try to understand even those meanings of the construction that do not describe anything.
